title: Scheduled builds for free accounts
---

Builds run on schedule is a feature we've been offering since early days of AppVeyor. It works great for many private and OSS projects. However, over the time we started noticing that there are a lot of "abandoned" projects with maintainers once configured scheduled builds and then leaving them running for the same commit over and over again.

Starting today we are making scheduled builds an optional feature for free accounts which is disabled by default. Paid accounts will continue to have scheduled builds enabled by default.

If you are the maintainer of OSS project and your CI workflow requires scheduled builds contact AppVeyor team and briefly describe your needs to request this feature.

Best regards,<br>
AppVeyor team
